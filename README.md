# safeconnect-bypass
Short script to bypass the SafeConnect network access control system.

I wrote this because SafeConnect wouldn't let me use ResNet because I didn't have antivirus installed on my work laptop. Except I did have an antivirus client installed, so it was kinda just annoying. The other SafeConnect solutions I tried didn't work so I just wrote my own.
